# hello-world
My first repository, hope it's gonna be easy

I'm Kevin, I have founded a free, efficient and genuine language learning method based on peer learning called Ayni. I am learning Git methodology so I can better understand web-development and hopefullyadd some code of my own!

Big bisous
